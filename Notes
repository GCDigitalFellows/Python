##Python Overview (10)##
	* Flexible programming language that has become the standard for academic researchers. 
	* Packages versus language
		* NLTK
		* Pandas
		* Numpy
	* import
		* import nltk - 'import' is a command, 'nltk' is a package
		* from nltk import * - this says 'go to nltk and import everything' - save yourself and don't do this
		* from nltk import concordance
			OMG! What's the difference??
			just importing the package, you have to call it every time, so nltk.concordance. Pulling in specific functions, you don't have to type nltk, but have to remember that that variable has already been used.
	* It's a language with rules and vocabulary - multiple ways of writing things just like multiple ways of saying things. 
	* Note about Object Oriented


##Variables & Types (30)##
	1. Variables - container for holding other things (notecards here)
		* Rules about variables
			* NO SPACES
			* must be unique (unless you're overwriting something)
			* cannot be a command Python already uses, or is already used by a package. 
		* Examples - let's do them together!
			Open iPython Notebook
				x = 8
				y = 2
				x + y [shift]+[enter]
				
				z = x - y
				print(z)
				
				Let's try another
				a = 3
				b = 4
				a = b --- what do you think happened here? Let's find out
				print(a)
				print(b)
				
				Trivial for this example, but absolutely necessary for writing clear, understandable code
				
		* Common usage
			afile = open('/Users/michellejohnson/Documents/Spanish_English_BYTs.csv', 'r')
			my_file = afile.read()
		
		
	2. Types
		a. Numbers
			i. Integers
			ii. Floats 
		b.  Strings "  "
			usually words, always things Python can't "evaluate"
		c. Lists  [  ]
			like a shopping list
		d. Dictionaries {  }
			key:value  pair - Keys are always unique - like your house key!
			Values are not always unique... Let's say you are counting words, [(a:200), (the, 500), (at, 200)] would be fine. 
			Useful for counting instances of things
			
	3. Type Examples
	Going to go through a bunch of disconnected examples. The purpose here is to get acquainted with the way Python works. Can think of it like building a toolbox or a learning a new language. Tourists often learn a variety of stock phrases, but to actually communicate, you have to learn about how the pieces work.
	
		a. Numbers covered in Variables
		
		b. Strings
			str1 = "Hello"
			str2 = "GCDI DRI"
			print(str1)
			print (str1, str2)
			str3 = str1 + str2
			What happened? Why wasn't there a space between them?
			Python can't evaluate inside of a string
			How do we get a space??
			srt1 + " " + str2
			
		c. Lists 
			like a shopping list
			groceries = ['apples', 'spinach', 'tofu']
			print(groceries)
			groceries.append('rice')
			
			print(groceries)
			
			You could set a new_variable here, like new_list = groceries.append(), but the original grocery list is still modified, so now you just have more variables and more confusion, so this is not ideal
			Python counts the objects in a list. Python, however, is a mathematician, and begins counting at Zero, this takes a little getting used to, but comes natural very quickly
			You can call an item in a list by telling Python which number item to pull out groceries[1] will return the second item in the list. 
			
			Lists are most often used for loops, which we will get to in the second half of this session
			
		d. Dictionaries
			key:value pair
			Most often used for counting things
			my_dict = {('steak', 2), ('potatoes', 5), ('cucumber', 6)}
			my_dict.keys()
			my_dict.values()
			my_dict.has_key('tofu')
